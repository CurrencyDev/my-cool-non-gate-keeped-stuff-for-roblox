contains SusChat, AntiWS, PullACL, Earthquake Controller
PullACL instructions are attached to the photo, but go adjust your webhooks and userid's in the PullACL_Service, you can also make a folder in ServerStorage called PullACL_Secrets, then put a StringValue in it called DiscordWebhook with your webhook url as the actual stringvalues value. If you'd like to just update that.

AntiWS Instructions: <img width="225" height="105" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a98ba90e-4edc-4e66-b088-520c5616f887" />

AntiWSManager goes to serverscriptservice, the local scripts go to StarterPlayerScripts, IncidentRecorder (yes, it actually records incidents/robang incidents) goes into replicated storage.

Should be easy enough! Earthquake controller is coming soon. And it will come with a custom ATOM LightBulb script that flickers the lights based on the earthquake!
