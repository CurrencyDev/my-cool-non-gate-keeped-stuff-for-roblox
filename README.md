contains SusChat, AntiWS, PullACL, Earthquake Controller
PullACL instructions are attached to the photo, but go adjust your webhooks and userid's in the PullACL_Service, you can also make a folder in ServerStorage called PullACL_Secrets, then put a StringValue in it called DiscordWebhook with your webhook url as the actual stringvalues value. If you'd like to just update that.

PullACL currently only works with the new revised Relcot RMP's, sorry about that, there'll be a version that works with the FTI BG-12's and other common pullstations, you could try doing it yourself though, won't guarantee warranty on that one.

AntiWS Instructions: <img width="225" height="105" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a98ba90e-4edc-4e66-b088-520c5616f887" />

AntiWSManager goes to serverscriptservice, the local scripts go to StarterPlayerScripts, IncidentRecorder (yes, it actually records incidents/robang incidents) goes into replicated storage.

Add whitelisted people in the manager, FOLLOW THE FORMAT!!!!! Or else it'll break, and you won't be able to use the AdminViewer! And if you break it too bad, the system won't work at all!

Should be easy enough! Earthquake controller is coming soon. And it will come with a custom ATOM LightBulb script that flickers the lights based on the earthquake!
